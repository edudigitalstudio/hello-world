# hello-world
Hi there im Eduardo Lopez. I like web development, photo and music. I was born in Mexico City in December 16th 1991. Im 25 years old and music lover. One of my biggest dreams in life is to travel around the world to know a lot of cultures and figure out how they make their own living, depending on the circumstaces and their environment.
